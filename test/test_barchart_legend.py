""" Bar Chart Legend test
This tests plots a simple bar chart.  Bar charts are plotted as
rectangle patches witch are difficult to tell from other rectangle
patches that should not be plotted in PGFPlots (e.g. axis, legend)

This also tests legends on barcharts. Which are difficult because
in PGFPlots, they have no \\addplot, and thus legend must be
manually added.
